Mastrogiannis Grappa is a single origin grape brandy from selected grape varieties. Our 2016 season consists of all red varieties including Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cab sauvignon, Malbec and Tempranillo. Our 2017 and 2018 batches are 100% Riesling.

We use no sugar to referment, what this means is you get a pure grappa from the pomace (the skins and seeds) of the grape varietal we are using, double distilled, non chill filterd and proofed with pure aquifer water, nothing else added so you get to taste the terroir of the grapes.

Our Grappa is a tribute to my dad, old school techniques, full flavor and what started the distillery as the initial product. We are very proud to offer a domestic grappa (or Tsipouro in Greek) that is without additional additives or flavorings.
