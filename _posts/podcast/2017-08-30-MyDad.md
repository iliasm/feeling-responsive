A very special episode. I had the privilade of sitting down with my brother and dad and recorded my dad's prespective around wine, how he started into this business, preference between red or white grapes, his favorite drink and so much more!

At 80 years old, he's still going strong and he has been the inspiration for a lot of things including the distillery and alot of my current processes around fermenation, wine making and distilling.
