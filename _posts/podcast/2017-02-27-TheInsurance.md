In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I chatted with Dianna Connelly, an insurance agent located in Washington state. Dianna recently helped me consolidate and review my insurance needs for 2017, I ask her some of my own questions and we talk everything from bonds to earthquake insurance.
