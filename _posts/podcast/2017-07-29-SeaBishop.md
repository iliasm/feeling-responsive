In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I had a chat with John Emrick from Sea Bishop distillery. Sea Bishop is located in Black Diamond WA and specilizing in Gin. John talked everything from issues with finding the right location, to distribution to streamlining his production process. An episode full of good solid advice and details around small craft Gin production!
