For our first episode of 2018, we decided to reverse the microphone and have Andrew a podcast listener and a big help during the 2017 harvest ask the normal questions I use for guests. We talk on how I started the distillery, favorite books, strengths and weaknesses and everything in between.

I hope you enjoy this and find value. If you do please leave us a review on Apple Podcasts, we read every single one and they help the podcast grow.
