In our last episode for 2017, we had the pleasure of talking with Jon Good from Green Door Distilling located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Jon had an incredible story and he shares with us his early years into the business, making booze, favorite books, habits and everything in between. A truly excellent episode to finish the year strong and continue into January 2018.

I hope you enjoy this and find value. Happy New Year, and kick ass in 2018!
