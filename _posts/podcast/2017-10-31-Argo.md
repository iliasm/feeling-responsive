In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I had a chat with Yannis Chandolias, owner and distiller of Argo distillery. Argo distillery is a producer of mastic liqueur and soon the first whisky of Greece. Located in Athens Greece, Yannis has a long family history in the trade of spirits and now with his own company producing an authentic spirit and soon something new for the region.
