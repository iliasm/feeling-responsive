This is a solo episode and I'm going over my process of obtaining my TTB permit for a Distilled Spirits Plant. I cover topics around the overall process, what where some of the issues I hit and overall from start to finish my experience with getting my approval along with the documentation aspect and why I had to lock-up the DSP.
