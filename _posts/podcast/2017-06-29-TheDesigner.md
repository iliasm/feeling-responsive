In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I chatted with Tim Girvin. Tim has over 40 years’ experience in the design space and has helped brands develop a strategy and story around their core and ideas. In this episode, we chatted about the things you need to include, how to tell your story and his advice for running a successful business. One tip, go check out Tim's handwriting on Youtube, its amazing.
