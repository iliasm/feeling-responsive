In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I talk with Skip Tognetti of Letterpress distilling. Skip shared his journey and some real talk about what it takes to open up a distillery, the sacrifies you have to do and his deep Italian roots. This interview was a blast and you get to see Skip and his passion for this business. I learned alot talking to Skip and his advice on being a problem solver struck a cord with me and you know that when Greeks and Italians talk its all good, don't miss this interview.
