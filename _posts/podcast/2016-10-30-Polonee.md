In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I talk with Adam Szymkow owner of Polonee Distillery. We jumped right into the issues with Adam and brought up issues with his custom bottles, and getting licensed in Canada to his approach to vodka with his four ingredients and his very accurate still. I had a blast talking with him and I do hope you enjoy this interview with Adam.
