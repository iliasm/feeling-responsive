In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast we talk to Jason Parker and Micah Nutt from CopperWorks Distilling and the creators of the CopperWorks Gin and Vodka! Jason and Micah together bring decades of experience in the brewing industry and they took that experience to open a very beautiful distillery by the Seattle waterfront. We talk about single malt whiskey how they build a river on top of a building and how location is important.
