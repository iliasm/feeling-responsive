In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I talk with AJ Temple. We talk about location issues, how his initial design cost paid in the long term and why getting the right mix of botanicals is not that easy to scale. We also bring up the references to why his bottles reference books and his future plans for the distillery.
