This is another solo episode which I cover the TTB findings on DSP audits, the mistakes and tips on ensuring you are in compliance. DSPs fall into a 5.7 billion taxation revenue (2015) so its important to accuratly and correctly determine proof gallons. We also talk about social media assurances, and why having a precision hydrometer is worth the extra money.
