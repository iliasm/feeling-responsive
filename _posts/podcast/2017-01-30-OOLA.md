In this episode of the Distillery Nation Podcast I chatted with Kirby Kallas-Lewis from OOLA Distillery, this is our first podcast for 2017 and we where super excited to feature Kirby and OOLA Distillery. We started the conversation with Kirby's background into art and how he crossed over to distilling. Why he choose distilling, being honest and transparent and what he would change in his first year of operation.
