<h3>What are we standing for.</h3>
<br>
If you hear my dad speak you will hear him often talk about the word <b>“Meraki”</b>, he will sometimes just roar at it when he’s creating something, making wine, or simply roasting a lamb on the spit!

Meraki doesn’t have a clear definition in English, but its roughly translated as the creativity and soul you put into everything you do regardless of the task at hand. Meraki defines the inner proud that all of us have when we achieve or drive towards a goal, knowing it’s our best work yet!

We are a Greek Brandy distillery producing world class spirits from 100% Washington wine and fruit. Meraki for us is not just a word that we choose, it’s a way of doing things the right way and being proud that whatever we put into that bottle is our best version yet!

For the consumer, this translates that our products are not only a true fruit to glass approach to distilling, but a way of life as our ethos won’t allow for anything less. 

<h3>Our Humble beginning.</h3>
<br>
A rocky start.
<br>
I clearly remember the day, time and where the idea came to me. It was a Wednesday night heading home to my family on the bus when I was pondering what is next, I wanted to start something that is truly greater than me and can have the potential to leave a legacy behind.
Then my parents came into the picture, both self-employed all their lives. My mom a farmer, my dad a mason. We were poor but my parents made sure we were not hungry and provided everything for us to succeed in our lives.

My dad twenty years ago, started making wine as a hobby, the hobby grew and became one of our main sources of income. The small wine business along with my parents saving habits helped put me and my brother through four years of college. During that day at the bus the idea to start and lead the family name forward was through a distillery that uses wine and or fruit as our base for everything came to be. It felt like a natural extension focusing on grappas, brandies and liquers all from fruit, supporting local farmers and business along the way.

A tribute to the “Meraki” as my dad says it helped us move to the next chapter in our lives.


A distillery is born.
<br>
Many attempts to find a suitable location, a failed contract distilling opportunity, purchase equipment, sell my house and creating my first batch. Mastrogiannis Distillery did its first batch of Ouzo from a red wine base on September 2016 armed with five botanicals we moved to Grappa and Brandy, where over the next few months we released our single origin Grappa’s, Brandies and Liqueurs all from 100% Washington wine and fruit.

Our Motto - <b>Meraki (μεράκι): The soul, creativity and love we put into everything we do.</b>

Cheers,
<br>
