We are a small 100% family owned and operated distillery located in Lakewood WA. Our goal is to produce authentic and tradtional brandies using local grapes and wine.

<h3>We select the best grapes.</h3>

We have partnered with the best people in the industry which allows us to select the best grapes possible. From crushing and fermenting the grapes allowing us total control from start to finish.

<h3>We use old school methodology.</h3>

We use traditional techniques that have been used in Greece for centuries. These have been passed down to me by my father and my grandfather.


<h3>And we distill.</h3>

Using our traditional handmade alembic copper pot still that was imported from Portugal.
